# coincidentally-iconic-visualizations
A repo for storing code and corresponding datasets which produce coincidental visualizations resembling iconic landmarks

While doing some Exploratory Data Analysis i came upon a histogram that resembled the Burj Khalifa. This got me thinking, how many other data visualization enthusiasts out there have come across similar coincidentally iconically resembling data visualizations?

The aim of this repo is to make similar findings available to others for replicative joy.
